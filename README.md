# Segmented-Image-Slices-Organized-into-Partial-Matrices-Using-OpenCV
This project provides a Python script that utilizes OpenCV to segment an input image into multiple slices and organize those slices into partial matrices. The algorithm applies a Hough Transform to detect lines in the image, which is particularly useful for images affected by the rolling shutter effect.
